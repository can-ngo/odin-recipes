        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Marinated fish</li>
            <li>Dressing</li>
            <li>Assembly</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare marinated fish: Whisk olive oil, vinegar, lime juice, lime zest, garlic, honey, seafood seasoning, hot pepper sauce, cumin, chili powder, and black pepper together in a bowl until blended. Place tilapia in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over the fish; cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Make the dressing: Combine sour cream and adobo sauce in a bowl. Stir in lime juice, lime zest, seafood seasoning, cumin, and chili powder. Add salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate until needed.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set the grate 4 inches from the heat.</li>
            <li>Remove fish from the marinade, drain off any excess and discard the marinade. Grill fish pieces until easily flaked with a fork, turning once, about 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>Assemble tacos: Place fish pieces in the center of tortillas with desired amounts of tomatoes, cabbage, and cilantro; drizzle with dressing.</li>
            <li>To serve, roll up tortillas around fillings, and garnish with lime wedges.</li>
        </ol>
